# Introduction

AMARCORD is a free and open-source database application designed to gather metadata about chemicals, runs and analysis results of serial crystallography (SX) experiments. The software features an easy-to-use, web-based user interface and was used in numerous experiments in order to cope with both the amount of data collected, as well as different experimental groups working during the same beam time. It was further extended not only to collect metadata, but also trigger analysis jobs and ingest the resulting figures of merit, resulting in a complete framework for running an SX experiment.

## Who's this for?

The target audience is *people doing serial crystallography*, be that *biologists*, *beamline scientists* or *researchers*. This document describes AMARCORD from all these different perspectives, and gives you a way to install and use AMARCORD.
