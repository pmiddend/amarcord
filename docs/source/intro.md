# Introduction

AMARCORD is a free and open-source database application designed to gather metadata about chemicals, runs and analysis results of serial crystallography (SX) experiments. The software features an easy-to-use, web-based user interface and was used in numerous experiments in order to cope with both the amount of data collected, as well as different experimental groups working during the same beam time. It was further extended not only to collect metadata, but also trigger analysis jobs and ingest the resulting figures of merit, resulting in a complete framework for running an SX experiment.

## Who's this for?

The target audience is *people doing serial crystallography*, be that *biologists*, *beamline scientists* or *researchers*. This document describes AMARCORD from all these different perspectives, and gives you a way to install and use AMARCORD.

## I'm interested — where do I go from here?

That depends on how you want to use AMARCORD:

- 👨‍💻 **Developer**: If you indend to extend AMARCORD, head over to the [](developer-guide)
- 🧑‍🔬 **Scientist**: If you're a scientist (biologist, beamline scientist, ...) who want to use AMARCORD (at a beamline that already has it installed, for example), the [](UserGuide) is your best bet to start.
- 🧑‍🔧 **Admin**: To learn how to install and maintain AMARCORD and its database, head over to the [](admin-guide)

Finally, if you're *any* of these and just want to try out AMARCORD, head to the [](QuickStart) section.
