## Introduction

This document will assume you're not a programmer, but a regular user of AMARCORD.

## Geometries

### Intro

To run indexing jobs, you need to provide a *geometry*, which defines *where* the detector is and how the detector pixels are *located* in relation to each other. Geometries are objects in AMARCORD that can be created, updated, deleted and simply enumerated in the user interface in the menu under "Library ‚Üí Geometries".

### Managing geometries

```{figure} menu-libraries.png

How to get to the overview
```

What you see is a list of currently available geometries:

```{figure} geometry-overview.png
Overview of all geometries (just one) of a sample beamtime.
```

Just as with chemicals, you can add a new geometry from scratch or copy one from a prior beam time. Below that is a list of all current geometries.

Let's look at what happens when you press "Add geometry". You will see a form such as this:

```{figure} add-geometry.png
Clicking "Add geometry" and entering some data.
```

As you can see, only two things are needed when adding a geometry. First is a name, which *must be unique inside this beam time*, and which will appear in drop-down menus for indexing jobs, as well as for finished indexing results.

Below that is the geometry content. This is simply a long piece of text, corresponding to the [CrystFEL geometry](https://gitlab.desy.de/thomas.white/crystfel/-/blob/master/doc/man/crystfel_geometry.5.md) file format. What you see on the screenshot is, of course, not a complete geometry, although `clen ...` is a directive indicating the *camera length*, sometimes also called detector distance (the distance from the detector to the sample).

Of note here is the ability to use *placeholders* in the geometry content. These placeholders are in the so-called [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) syntax, which you don't *really* have to learn. Just remember that you can use terms like `{{attributo_name}}` inside the geometry, which will be replaced by the actual attributo value for the run that we are indexing with. If you have a run table like this:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Run ID</th>
<th>Detector Distance</th>
<th>Energy</th>
<th>...</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>200.0</td>
<td>14.000eV</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>201.0</td>
<td>14.500eV</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>205.0</td>
<td>14.000eV</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>

And you start an indexing job with the geometry above, we would get:

```
clen 200.0

more stuff here
```

as the geometry for run 1, for example.

Note that *editing* and *deleting* geometries is only possible if it is not in use in an indexing job. Once it's used, it stays.

### Using geometries

Geometries are needed during indexing, so if you start a new indexing job, you will see a drop-down menu with the available geometries:

```{figure} geometry-selection.png
Upon starting a new indexing job, we're greeted by this drop-down. Note that here, `geometry-v3.geom` is a geometry we uploaded manually, whereas the other ones are *generated* (see below).
```

Just select a geometry and submit the job. It will start an indexing job for each run, and use an adapted geometry for each one.

### Problems with changing Run Attributo later

Let's say we have a few runs:

| Run ID | Detector Distance | Group |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1      | 200               | 1     |
| 2      | 300               | 1     |
| 3      | 400               | 1     |

For simplicity, let's say all these runs are part of a single Data Set (with an Experiment Type that has "Group" as the only column).

Furthermore, we have a template that uses the *Detector Distance*, like this:

```
clen = {{Detector Distance}} mm
...
```

If we now start indexing this data set, we end up with a few objects in the database:

- One *Indexing Parameter* object, containing a link to our aforementioned geometry, with the *Detector Distance* not replaced.
- Three *Indexing Result* objects, referencing the *Indexing Parameter* object just mentioned, and the *Run* that was indexed. This also contains the template replacements, so we end up with these results:

| Indexing ID | Parameter ID | Run ID | Detector Distance | Indexed Frames |
|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1001        | 101          | 1      | 200               | 50             |
| 1002        | 101          | 2      | 300               | 0              |
| 1003        | 101          | 3      | 400               | 500            |

Notice that indexing result 1002 has no indexed frames. We double-check and see that the *Detector Distance* for this run is wrong. It is supposed to be 200, not 300, so the geometry ends up wrong, leading to these results.

Now we have a problem. We could change run 2's detector distance to 200. But what about indexing result 1002? It's still *relevant* somehow - it might even be part of a merge result, in case we merged indexing ID 1001, 1002, 1003 together (although with 0 indexed frames, it doesn't really play a role).

We have thought about this conundrum and decided to solve this rather radically: if you change the *Detector Distance* in the run (or any attribute from a geometry replacement), you are given an error message, telling you what's wrong about it. You are then given the option of changing the attributo anyways, but this will delete all indexing results and optionally merge results that involve this attributo!

```{figure} delete-dependent.png

Sample of an error message when trying to edit an Attributo that is being used. Below that is the checkbox remedying the situation by deleting said indexing results (and merge results attached!).
```

### Discussion on the templating format

This is only for developers and people interested. We chose mustache as a template format because it was standardized (i.e. it has a language-agnostic spec), and because it has support in both of AMARCORD's programming languages: Elm and Python.
