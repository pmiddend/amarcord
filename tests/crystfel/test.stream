This is what I understood your unit cell to be:
tetragonal P, unique axis c, right handed.
a      b      c            alpha   beta  gamma
 79.20  79.20  38.00 A     90.00  90.00  90.00 deg
List of indexing methods:
   0: asdf-nolatt-cell          (asdf using cell parameters as prior information)
Indexing parameters:
                  Check unit cell parameters: on
                        Check peak alignment: on
                   Refine indexing solutions: on
 Multi-lattice indexing ("delete and retry"): off
                              Retry indexing: off
